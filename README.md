# TextualStyleTransfer
This repository is a summery of the project: "The Stylish Autoencoder" by galshachaf and RoyHirsch {Tel Aviv University}

# Abstract:
Textual style transfer is a developing area of re-search. The majority of the works on the task tryto disentangle the content and the style in the textusing generative models and adversarial losses. Inthis work we propose a new method for trainingan attentive stylish text generation model withoutparallel data. Our model is easy to train, compu-tationally efficient and scalable.  Our model is aself-attention-based encoder decoder, trained inback translation manner with the supervision ofpretrained style classifier
The model with the train methodology as well as the train and test data can be found here.
